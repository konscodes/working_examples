'''
Basic json data manipulation example.
This snippet shows how to read and write json data.
- The json data is stored in a file files/teams.json.
- The json data is read and stored in a dictionary.
- Function is called to search the dictionary for a specific duty.
    - Print the team name and the team members.
    - Remove the duty for the team.
    - Add the duty for the next team in the dictionary.
- Write the dictionary back to the json file.
